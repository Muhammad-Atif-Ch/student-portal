        <div class="date">Effective Date: June 12, 2025</div>

        <div class="heading">1. Information We Collect</div>
        <div class="text">
            We do not collect personally identifiable information such as name,
            email address, or phone number. We only use the device identifier
            (Device ID) to associate usage and in-app purchases with your device.
        </div>

        <div class="heading">2. How We Use Your Information</div>
        <div class="text">
            We use your Device ID solely for the following purposes:<br />
            • To personalize your experience within the app.<br />
            • To manage and verify in-app purchases and subscriptions.<br />
            • To improve app performance and user experience through analytics.
        </div>

        <div class="heading">3. In-App Purchases</div>
        <div class="text">
            Our app offers in-app subscriptions that grant access to premium
            content. Payments are processed securely through the app store’s
            payment system. We do not store or process any payment information.
        </div>

        <div class="heading">4. Data Sharing</div>
        <div class="text">
            We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties, including
            any government agencies, except:<br />
            • If required by law, regulation, or legal process.<br />
            • With your explicit consent.
        </div>

        <div class="heading">5. Data Retention</div>
        <div class="text">
            We retain non-personal data (like usage analytics and Device ID) as
            long as necessary for the purposes outlined in this policy or as
            required by applicable laws.
        </div>

        <div class="heading">6. Security</div>
        <div class="text">
            We implement appropriate security measures to protect your data.
            However, no system is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute
            protection.
        </div>

        <div class="heading">7. Children’s Privacy</div>
        <div class="text">

            do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If you believe

        </div>

        <div class="heading">8. Changes to This Policy</div>
        <div class="text">

            be posted in the app and/or on this page with the revised effective
            date.
